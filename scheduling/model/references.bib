Intersection traffic signal controllers are a crucial part of today's transportation infrastructure, as sub-optimal policies may lead to traffic jams and as a result increased levels of air pollution and wasted time. Many adaptive traffic signal controllers have been proposed in the literature, but research on their relative performance differences is limited. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge there has been no work that directly targets CO2 emission reduction, even though pollution is currently a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a reward shaping scheme for various RL algorithms that not only produces lowers CO2 emissions, but also produces respectable outcomes in terms of other metrics such as travel time. We compare multiple RL algorithms \textemdash{} sarsa, and A2C \textemdash{} as well as diverse scenarios with a mix of different road users emitting varied amounts of pollution.},

We propose a new notion of task relatedness between source and target tasks, and develop a novel approach for representational transfer under this assumption. Concretely, we show that given a generative access to source tasks, we can discover a representation, using which subsequent linear RL techniques quickly converge to a near-optimal policy, with only online access to the target task. The sample complexity is close to knowing the ground truth features in the target task, and comparable to prior representation learning results in the source tasks. We complement our positive results with lower bounds without generative access, and validate our findings with empirical evaluation on rich observation MDPs that require deep exploration.},

  abstract = {In reinforcement learning (RL), dealing with non-stationarity is a challenging issue. However, some domains such as traffic optimization are inherently non-stationary. Causes for and effects of this are manifold. In particular, when dealing with traffic signal controls, addressing non-stationarity is key since traffic conditions change over time and as a function of traffic control decisions taken in other parts of a network. In this paper we analyze the effects that different sources of non-stationarity have in a network of traffic signals, in which each signal is modeled as a learning agent. More precisely, we study both the effects of changing the context in which an agent learns (e.g., a change in flow rates experienced by it), as well as the effects of reducing agent observability of the true environment state. Partial observability may cause distinct states (in which distinct actions are optimal) to be seen as the same by the traffic signal agents. This, in turn, may lead to sub-optimal performance. We show that the lack of suitable sensors to provide a representative observation of the real state seems to affect the performance more drastically than the changes to the underlying traffic patterns.},

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques present powerful frameworks for optimizing traffic signal controllers that learn to respond to real-time traffic changes. Multiagent RL (MARL) techniques have been showing better results over centralized techniques (RL-based or not), where local intersection agents have partial observation of and control over the environment. Since in TSC the best decision does not depend only on local information, in the present paper we aim at increasing agents' views by using a hierarchical approach, where information is passed upwards, is then aggregated forming recommendations that are sent downwards. We divide the transportation network into regions, each controlled by a region agent; this is done at different hierarchical levels. The traffic signal controllers, located at the intersections, are the local agents at the hierarchy's bottom. Region agents can supervise intersection agents or other region agents. Evaluation of this approach in a synthetic traffic grid shows that the proposed hierarchical organization outperforms a fixed-time approach and an RL-based approach without hierarchy.},

A scalable distributed Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) is devised that solves the scheduling problem for a grid of intersections.

Each node assigns an intersection access time to every subscribed vehicle by solving a local MILP. Neighboring intersections will coordinate with each other in real-time by sharing their solutions for vehicles' access times with each other. Our proposed approach is applied to a grid of nine intersections and its positive impact on traffic flow and vehicles' fuel economy is demonstrated in comparison to conventional intersection control scenarios.},

As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the ``agentification'' of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them.},

Firstly, quickly computed lower bounds are obtained using a procedure which is based on job splitting. The job splitting methodology is shown to be applicable to a range of total weighted completion time scheduling problems. Secondly, the branching rule includes a release date adjustment mechanism which increases release dates at certain nodes of the tree with a view to tightening lower bounds. Thirdly, the branch and bound algorithm includes a new dominance rule for eliminating nodes of the search tree. Computational experience on problems with up to 50 jobs indicates that the proposed algorithm is superior to other known algorithms.},

The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must instead discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multi-agent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multi-agent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim\textemdash either explicitly or implicitly\textemdash at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

To place an ad automatically and optimally, it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition, we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation using neural networks. The empirical study on two large-scale real-world datasets and the live A/B testing on a commercial platform have demonstrated the superior performance and high efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Is there a general method for handling uncertainty? Or, at least, are there rules that could in principle be followed by an ideally rational mind when discussing scientific matters? What makes one statement more plausible than another? How much more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we change our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are there rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are they unique? And, come to think of it, what, after all, is information? It is clear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely mean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can we measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the main tools for inductive inference--probability and entropy--from a thoroughly Bayesian point of view and to illustrate their use in physics with examples borrowed from the foundations of classical statistical physics.},

  abstract = {Boltzmann exploration is a classic strategy for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and is one of the most standard tools in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Despite its widespread use, there is virtually no theoretical understanding about the limitations or the actual benefits of this exploration scheme. Does it drive exploration in a meaningful way? Is it prone to misidentifying the optimal actions or spending too much time exploring the suboptimal ones? What is the right tuning for the learning rate? In this paper, we address several of these questions in the classic setup of stochastic multi-armed bandits. One of our main results is showing that the Boltzmann exploration strategy with any monotone learning-rate sequence will induce suboptimal behavior. As a remedy, we offer a simple non-monotone schedule that guarantees near-optimal performance, albeit only when given prior access to key problem parameters that are typically not available in practical situations (like the time horizon \$T\$ and the suboptimality gap \$\textbackslash Delta\$). More importantly, we propose a novel variant that uses different learning rates for different arms, and achieves a distribution-dependent regret bound of order \$\textbackslash frac\{K\textbackslash log\^2 T\}\{\textbackslash Delta\}\$ and a distribution-independent bound of order \$\textbackslash sqrt\{KT\}\textbackslash log K\$ without requiring such prior knowledge. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we also propose a variant that guarantees the same performance bounds even if the rewards are heavy-tailed.},

Previous methods usually rely on the sequential stepby-step processing of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and merely extract the interactions between spatial neighbors for single type traffic-agents. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Transformer Networks (S2TNet), which models the spatio-temporal interactions by spatio-temporal Transformer and deals with the temporel sequences by temporal Transformer.

To the best of our knowledge, little research has been devoted to this scheduling problem. Therefore, we developed two exact algorithms, including a constraint programming model and a branch-and-bound method for small problems. The obtained optimal solutions can be used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of heuristics. With the complexity in mind, two heuristics, including a best index dispatch (BID) and a modified weighted shortest processing time (MWSPT) based on non-delay concepts are also proposed for large problems. The time complexities of the two proposed heuristics are O(n4) and O(n3), respectively. The computational results showed that the branch-andbound method could solve most instances with 40 jobs under the time limit of 7,200 s. The BID heuristic is superior to the MWSPT in solution quality, although both can efficiently and effectively obtain near-optimal solutions for large instances.},

We show that MDDs can be used to represent a wide range of sequencing problems with various side constraints and objective functions, and demonstrate how MDDs can be added to existing constraint-based scheduling systems.

The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.},

The method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations. After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying origin-destination (O-D) table is given and that the proportion of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions, the best routes to each destination from every junction are known at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about an order of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article will lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute.},

A conventional setup for notoriously difficult queueing network control problems is a Markov decision problem (MDP) that has three features: infinite state space, unbounded costs, and long-run average cost objective. We extend the theoretical framework of these APG methods for such MDP problems. The resulting PPO algorithm is tested on a parallel-server system and large-size multiclass queueing networks. The algorithm consistently generates control policies that outperform state-of-art heuristics in literature in a variety of load conditions from light to heavy traffic. These policies are demonstrated to be near optimal when the optimal policy can be computed. A key to the successes of our PPO algorithm is the use of three variance reduction techniques in estimating the relative value function via sampling. First, we use a discounted relative value function as an approximation of the relative value function. Second, we propose regenerative simulation to estimate the discounted relative value function. Finally, we incorporate the approximating martingale-process method into the regenerative estimator.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for mobility in our society poses various challenges to traffic engineering, computer science in general, and artificial intelligence in particular. As it is often the case, it is not possible to increase the capacity of road networks, therefore a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is required. This relates closely to multiagent systems and to multiagent reinforcement learning, as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. However, one of the main challenges of this domain is that the state space is large and continuous, which makes it difficult to properly discretize states and also causes many RL algorithms to converge more slowly. To address these issues, a multiagent system with agents learning independently via a temporal difference learning algorithm based on k-nearest neighbors is presented as an option to control traffic signals in real-time. Our results show that the proposed method is both effective (reduces the average waiting time of vehicles in a traffic network) and efficient (the learning task is significantly accelerated), when compared to a baseline reported in the literature.},

A DNN is made up of layers of internal units (or neurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the units in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the corresponding value (also known as activation). A commonly-used nonlinear operator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just the maximum between its input value and zero. In this (and other similar cases like max pooling, where the max operation involves more than one input value), for fixed parameters one can model the DNN as a 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Program (0-1 MILP) where the continuous variables correspond to the output values of each unit, and a binary variable is associated with each ReLU to model its yes/no nature. In this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and describe an effective bound-tightening technique intended to ease its solution. We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples. Computational results are reported, aimed at investigating (on small DNNs) the computational performance of a state-of-the-art MILP solver when applied to a known test case, namely, hand-written digit recognition.},

In such cases, agents need to identify the changes and adapt their behaviour, by evolving their goals or even generating new goals to address the emerging requirements. Learning and practical reasoning techniques have been used to enable agents with limited knowledge to adapt to new circumstances. However, they depend on the availability of large amounts of data, require long exploration periods, and cannot help agents to set new goals. Furthermore, the accuracy of agents' actions is improved by introducing added intelligence through integrating conceptual features extracted from ontologies. However, the concerns related to taking suitable actions when unseen situations occur are not addressed. This paper proposes a new Automatic Goal Generation Model (AGGM) that enables agents to create new goals to handle unseen situations and to adapt to their ever-changing environment on a real-time basis. AGGM is compared to Q-learning, SARSA, and Deep Q Network in a Traffic Signal Control System case study. The results show that AGGM outperforms the baseline algorithms in unseen situations while handling the seen situations as well as the baseline algorithms.},

We first discuss models and methods for Bayesian inference in the simple single-step Bandit model. We then review the extensive recent literature on Bayesian methods for model-based RL, where prior information can be expressed on the parameters of the Markov model. We also present Bayesian methods for model-free RL, where priors are expressed over the value function or policy class.

Effective operation of these systems requires that sensing and actuation tasks are performed in a timely manner. Additionally, execution of mission specific tasks such as imaging a room must be balanced against the need to perform more general tasks such as obstacle avoidance. This problem has been addressed by maintaining relative utilization of shared resources among tasks near a user-specified target level. Producing optimal scheduling strategies requires complete prior knowledge of task behavior, which is unlikely to be available in practice.

Combining data-driven applications with transportation systems plays a key role in recent transportation applications. In this paper, the latest deep reinforcement learning (RL) based traffic control applications are surveyed. Specifically, traffic signal control (TSC) applications based on (deep) RL, which have been studied extensively in the literature, are discussed in detail. Different problem formulations, RL parameters, and simulation environments for TSC are discussed comprehensively. In the literature, there are also several autonomous driving applications studied with deep RL models. Our survey extensively summarizes existing works in this field by categorizing them with respect to application types, control models and studied algorithms. In the end, we discuss the challenges and open questions regarding deep RL-based transportation applications.},

To plan reliably and efficiently while the approximate simulator is learning, we develop a method that adaptively decides which simulator to use for every simulation, based on a statistic that measures the accuracy of the approximate simulator. This allows us to use the approximate simulator to replace the original simulator for faster simulations when it is accurate enough under the current context, thus trading off simulation speed and accuracy. Experimental results in two large domains show that when integrated with POMCP, our approach allows to plan with improving efficiency over time.},

  abstract = {A unified platoon-based mathematical formulation called PAMSCOD is presented to perform arterial (network) traffic signal control while considering multiple travel modes in a vehicle-to-infrastructure communications environment. First, a headway-based platoon recognition algorithm is developed to identify pseudo-platoons given probe vehicles' online information. It is assumed that passenger vehicles constitute a significant majority of the vehicles in the network. This algorithm identifies existing queues and significant platoons approaching each intersection. Second, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is solved to determine future optimal signal plans based on the current traffic controller status, online platoon data and priority requests from special vehicles, such as transit buses. Deviating from the traditional common network cycle length, PAMSCOD aims to provide multi-modal dynamical progression (MDP) on the arterial based on the probe information. Microscopic simulation using VISSIM shows that PAMSCOD can easily handle two common traffic modes, transit buses and automobiles, and significantly reduce delays for both modes under both non-saturated and oversaturated traffic conditions as compared to traditional state-of-practice coordinated-actuated signal control with timings optimized by SYNCHRO.},

In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic.

While traditional approaches based on prior system specification or model learning are challenged by the complexity and the dynamicity of these systems, a new paradigm of learning in interaction brings a strong promise - based on the toolset of model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its great success stories in various domains. However, current RL methods still struggle to learn rapidly in incremental, online settings, which is a barrier to deal with many practical problems. To address the slow convergence issue, one approach consists in exploiting the system's structural properties, instead of acting in full model-free mode. In this paper, we review the existing resource management systems and unveil their common structural properties. We propose a meta-model and discuss the tracks on how these properties can enhance general purpose RL algorithms.},

  abstract = {Contemporary 3D games are often situated within large urban environments. This necessitates a time-consuming and expensive content creation process involving the modelling of vast amounts of geometric detail: including terrain, roads, buildings, and other associated features. We present a system called Citygen that aims to automate as much of this as possible by employing procedural generation methods to rapidly create the urban geometry typical of a modern city. Procedural methods have long been used within the graphics and game development communities to generate natural phenomena such as plants and trees. We employ these methods to generate the underlying road networks that form the structure of cities and urban neighbourhoods. These road networks are automatically mapped to any supplied terrain model, and adapt themselves to the specific geometry of the underlying terrain. Building footprints are automatically extracted from the resulting model and buildings can then be inserted either procedurally or by hand. Our system is unique in that it is designed to allow developers hands-on interactive control over the generation process. We achieve this by providing an interface allowing the user to directly manipulate geometric elements such as road intersection nodes, and to directly control and specify many aspects of the procedural generation. The results are updated in real time, thus facilitating an interactive design process.},

  abstract = {In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the goal is to learn a highly rewarding policy based solely on a dataset of historical interactions with the environment. The ability to train RL policies offline can greatly expand the applicability of RL, its data efficiency, and its experimental velocity. Prior work in offline RL has been confined almost exclusively to model-free RL approaches. In this work, we present MOReL, an algorithmic framework for model-based offline RL. This framework consists of two steps: (a) learning a pessimistic MDP (P-MDP) using the offline dataset; and (b) learning a near-optimal policy in this P-MDP. The learned P-MDP has the property that for any policy, the performance in the real environment is approximately lower-bounded by the performance in the P-MDP. This enables it to serve as a good surrogate for purposes of policy evaluation and learning, and overcome common pitfalls of model-based RL like model exploitation. Theoretically, we show that MOReL is minimax optimal (up to log factors) for offline RL. Through experiments, we show that MOReL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art results in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, the modular design of MOReL enables future advances in its components (e.g. generative modeling, uncertainty estimation, planning etc.) to directly translate into advances for offline RL.},

We believe synthetic urban areas generated via procedural city generation, which is a technique mostly used in the gaming area, could help improve the state-of-the-art in many disciplines which study urban areas. In this paper, we describe a selection of research areas that could benefit from such synthetic urban data and show that the current research in procedurally generated cities needs to address specific issues (e.g., plausibility) to sufficiently capture real-world cities and thus take such data beyond gaming.},

  abstract = {Since traffic jams are ubiquitous in the modern world, optimizing the behavior of traffic lights for efficient traffic flow is a critically important goal. Though most current traffic lights use simple heuristic protocols, more efficient controllers can be discovered automatically via multiagent reinforcement learning, where each agent controls a single traffic light. However, in previous work on this approach, agents select only locally optimal actions without coordinating their behavior. This paper extends this approach to include explicit coordination between neighboring traffic lights. Coordination is achieved using the max-plus algorithm, which estimates the optimal joint action by sending locally optimized messages among connected agents. This paper presents the first application of max-plus to a large-scale problem and thus verifies its efficacy in realistic settings. It also provides empirical evidence that max-plus performs well on cyclic graphs, though it has been proven to converge only for tree-structured graphs. Furthermore, it provides a new understanding of the properties a traffic network must have for such coordination to be beneficial and shows that max-plus outperforms previous methods on networks that possess those properties.},

  abstract = {Trains' movements on a railway network are regulated by official timetables. Deviations and delays occur quite often in practice, demanding fast rescheduling and rerouting decisions in order to avoid conflicts and minimize overall delay. This is the real-time train dispatching problem. In contrast with the classic ``holistic'' approach, we show how to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems associated with the line and the stations. This decomposition is the basis for a master-slave solution algorithm, in which the master problem is associated with the line and the slave problem is associated with the stations. The two subproblems are modeled as mixed integer linear programs, with specific sets of variables and constraints. Similarly to the classical Benders' decomposition approach, slave and master communicate through suitable feasibility cuts in the variables of the master. Extensive tests on real-life instances from single and double-track lines in Italy showed significant improvements over current dispatching performances. A decision support system based on this exact approach has been in operation in Norway since February 2014 and represents one of the first operative applications of mathematical optimization to train dispatching.},

  abstract = {A central problem in traffic management is that of scheduling the movements of vehicles so as to minimize the cost of the schedule. It arises in important applications such as train timetabling, rescheduling, delay and disruption management, airplane surface routing, runway scheduling, air-traffic control, and more. This problem can be modeled as a job-shop scheduling problem. We introduce a new mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation for job-shop scheduling, which is an alternative to classical approaches, namely, big-M and time-indexed formulations. It does not make use of artificially large coefficients, and its constraints correspond to basic graph structures, such as paths, cycles, and trees. The new formulation can be obtained by strengthening and lifting the constraints of a classical Benders' reformulation. Tests on a large set of real-life instances from train rescheduling show that the new approach performs on average better than our previous approaches based on big-M formulations and particularly better on a class of instances with nonconvex costs very common in the practice.},

  abstract = {Train movements on railway lines are generally controlled by human dispatchers. Because disruptions often occur, dispatchers make real-time scheduling and routing decisions in an attempt to minimize deviations from the official timetable. This optimization problem is called train dispatching. We represent it as a mixed integer linear programming model, and solve it with a Benders'-like decomposition within a suitable master/slave scheme. Interestingly, the master and the slave problems correspond to a macroscopic and microscopic representation of the railway, recently exploited in heuristic approaches to the problem. The decomposition, along with some new modeling ideas, allowed us to solve real-life instances of practical interest to optimality. Automatic dispatching systems based on our macro/micro decomposition\textemdash in which both master and slave are solved heuristically\textemdash have been in operation in several Italian lines since 2011. The exact approach described in this paper outperforms such systems on our test bed of real-life instances. Furthermore, a system based on another version of the exact decomposition approach has been in operation since February 2014 on a line in Norway.},

We thus study the problem of batch policy learning under multiple constraints, and offer a systematic solution. We first propose a flexible meta-algorithm that admits any batch reinforcement learning and online learning procedure as subroutines. We then present a specific algorithmic instantiation and provide performance guarantees for the main objective and all constraints. To certify constraint satisfaction, we propose a new and simple method for off-policy policy evaluation (OPE) and derive PAC-style bounds. Our algorithm achieves strong empirical results in different domains, including in a challenging problem of simulated car driving subject to multiple constraints such as lane keeping and smooth driving. We also show experimentally that our OPE method outperforms other popular OPE techniques on a standalone basis, especially in a high-dimensional setting.},

The signal optimization and coordination problem are first formulated in a centralized scheme as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The optimal phase durations and offsets are solved together by minimizing fuel consumption and travel time considering an individual vehicle's trajectories. Due to the complexity of the model, we decompose the problem into two levels: an intersection level to optimize phase durations using dynamic programming (DP), and a corridor level to optimize the offsets of all intersections. In order to solve the two-level model, a prediction-based solution technique is developed. The proposed models are tested using traffic simulation under various scenarios. Compared with the traditional actuated signal timing and coordination plan, the signal timing plans generated by solving the MINLP and the two-level model can reasonably improve the signal control performance. When considering varies vehicle types under high demand levels, the proposed two-level model reduced the total system cost by 3.8\% comparing to baseline actuated plan. MINLP reduced the system cost by 5.9\%. It also suggested that coordination scheme was beneficial to corridors with relatively high demand levels. For intersections with major and minor street, coordination conducted for major street had little impacts on the vehicles at the minor street.},

The problem can be first formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, by considering the information of individual vehicle's trajectories (i.e., second-by-second vehicle locations and speeds) and their realistic driving/car-following behaviors. The objective function is to minimize the weighted sum of total fuel consumption and travel time. Due to the large dimension of the problem and the complexity of the nonlinear car-following model, solving the nonlinear program directly is challenging. We then reformulate the problem as a dynamic programming model by dividing the timing decisions into stages (one stage for a signal phase) and approximating the fuel consumption and travel time of a stage as functions of the state and decision variables of the stage. We also propose a twostep method to make sure that the obtained optimal solution can lead to the fixed cycle length.

Adaptive traffic signal control studies can be categorized into modeling-based approaches and learning-based approaches. In order to take advantages of these two systems, this study developed an offline-online combined Partial Observable Imitation Network for Traffic signal control (POINT). In the offline system, the traffic signal timing optimization problem was formulated as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) given complete traffic information, i.e., second-by-second speeds and locations of all vehicles. The objective of MINLP is to minimize total travel delays considering individual vehicle trajectories under Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. The calculated optimal solutions under various traffic conditions were considered as the ''expert'' decisions. In the online system, an imitation neural network model was developed to learn the ''expert'' signal plans generated from offline system. Given partial observable traffic conditions in real time, e.g., the aggregate-level of traffic volume, the POINT model can compute the signal timing parameters in the online system. The numerical results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other state-of-the-art signal control method under high and unbalanced traffic demand levels in terms of reducing travel delays and queue length.},

These algorithms, however, often cannot be directly applied to physical systems, especially in cases where there are constraints to satisfy (e.g. to ensure safety or limit resource consumption). In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any policy with the sole goal of maximizing reward; in the real world, however, ensuring satisfaction of certain constraints in the process is also necessary and essential. In this article, we overview existing approaches addressing constraints in model-free reinforcement learning. We model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and consider two main types of constraints: cumulative and instantaneous. We summarize existing approaches and discuss their pros and cons. To evaluate policy performance under constraints, we introduce a set of standard benchmarks and metrics.

Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore better than classical exploration methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider distributed versions of a modified shifting bottleneck heuristic for complex job shops. The considered job shop environment contains parallel batching machines, machines with sequence-dependent setup times and reentrant process flows. Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities are typical examples for manufacturing systems with these characteristics. The used performance measure is total weighted tardiness (TWT). We suggest a two-layer hierarchical approach in order to decompose the overall scheduling problem. The upper (or top) layer works on an aggregated model. Based on appropriately aggregated routes it determines start dates and planned due dates for the jobs within each single work area, where a work area is defined as a set of parallel machine groups. The lower (or base) layer uses the start dates and planned due dates in order to apply shifting bottleneck heuristic type solution approaches for the jobs in each single work area. We conduct simulation experiments in a dynamic job shop environment in order to assess the performance of the heuristic. It turns out that the suggested approach outperforms a pure First In First Out (FIFO) dispatching scheme and provides a similar solution quality as the original modified shifting bottleneck heuristic.},

We first show that the Bellman equation, which is a recursive formula for the expected return, can be extended to the cumulative return distribution. Then we derive a nonparametric return distribution estimator with particle smoothing based on this extended Bellman equation. A key aspect of the proposed algorithm is to represent the recursion relation in the extended Bellman equation by a simple replacement procedure of particles associated with a state by using those of the successor state. We show that our algorithm leads to a risksensitive RL paradigm. The usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments.},

In this paper, we explore an alternative method for 3D object generation which produces 3D models in only 1-2 minutes on a single GPU. Our method first generates a single synthetic view using a text-to-image diffusion model, and then produces a 3D point cloud using a second diffusion model which conditions on the generated image. While our method still falls short of the state-of-the-art in terms of sample quality, it is one to two orders of magnitude faster to sample from, offering a practical trade-off for some use cases.

  abstract = {Improvement of traffic signal control (TSC) efficiency has been found to lead to improved urban transportation and enhanced quality of life. Recently, the use of reinforcement learning (RL) in various areas of TSC has gained significant traction; thus, we conducted a systematic literature review as a systematic, comprehensive, and reproducible review to dissect all the existing research that applied RL in the network-level TSC domain, called as RL in NTSC or RL-NTSC for brevity. The review only targeted the network-level articles that tested the proposed methods in networks with two or more intersections. This review covers 160 peer-reviewed articles from 30 countries published from 1994 to March 2020. The goal of this study is to provide the research community with statistical and conceptual knowledge, summarize existence evidence, characterize RL applications in NTSC domains, explore all applied methods and major first events in the defined scope, and identify areas for further research based on the explored research problems in current research. We analyzed the extracted data from the included articles in the following seven categories: (i) publication and authors' data, (ii) method identification and analysis, (iii) environment attributes and traffic simulation, (iv) application domains of RL-NTSC, (v) major first events of RL-NTSC and authors' key statements, (vi) code availability, and (vii) evaluation. This paper provides a comprehensive view of the past 26 years of research on applying RL to NTSC. It also reveals the role of advancing deep learning methods in the revival of the research area, the rise of using non-commercial microscopic traffic simulators, a lack of interaction between traffic and transportation engineering practitioners and researchers, and a lack of proposal and creation of testbeds which can likely bring different communities together around common goals.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

This paper studies the use of TD(0), a canonical TD algorithm, to estimate the value function of a given policy from a batch of data. In this batch setting, we show that TD(0) may converge to an inaccurate value function because the update following an action is weighted according to the number of times that action occurred in the batch \textendash{} not the true probability of the action under the given policy. To address this limitation, we introduce policy sampling error corrected-TD(0) (PSEC-TD(0)). PSEC-TD(0) first estimates the empirical distribution of actions in each state in the batch and then uses importance sampling to correct for the mismatch between the empirical weighting and the correct weighting for updates following each action. We refine the concept of a certainty-equivalence estimate and argue that PSEC-TD(0) is a more data efficient estimator than TD(0) for a fixed batch of data. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of PSEC-TD(0) on three batch value function learning tasks, with a hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, and show that PSEC-TD(0) produces value function estimates with lower mean squared error than TD(0).},

However, there is still a wide range of domains inaccessible to RL due to the high cost and danger of interacting with the environment. Offline RL is a paradigm that learns exclusively from static datasets of previously collected interactions, making it feasible to extract policies from large and diverse training datasets. Effective offline RL algorithms have a much wider range of applications than online RL, being particularly appealing for real-world applications such as education, healthcare, and robotics. In this work, we propose a unifying taxonomy to classify offline RL methods. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest algorithmic breakthroughs in the field, and a review of existing benchmarks' properties and shortcomings. Finally, we provide our perspective on open problems and propose future research directions for this rapidly growing field.},

More recently, simpler structures have also been introduced for predicting pedestrian trajectories, based on Transformer Networks, and using positional information [1]. They allow the individual modelling of each agent's trajectory separately without any complex interaction terms. Our model exploits these simple structures by adding augmented data (position and heading), and adapting their use to the problem of vehicle trajectory prediction in urban scenarios in prediction horizons up to 5 seconds. In addition, a cross-performance analysis is performed between different types of scenarios, including highways, intersections and roundabouts, using recent datasets (inD, rounD, highD and INTERACTION). Our model achieves state-of-the-art results and proves to be flexible and adaptable to different types of urban contexts.},

  abstract = {We describe an exact combinatorial learning approach to solve dynamic job-shop scheduling problems arising in traffic management. When a set of vehicles has to be controlled in real-time, a new schedule must be computed whenever a deviation from the current plan is detected, or periodically after a short amount of time. This suggests that each two (or more) consecutive instances will be very similar. We exploit a recently introduced MILP formulation for job-shop scheduling (called path\&cycle) to develop an effective solution algorithm based on delayed row generation. In our re-optimization framework, the algorithm maintains a pool of combinatorial cuts separated during the solution of previous instances, and adapts them to warm start each new instance. In our experiments, this adaptive approach led to a 4-time average speedup over the static approach (where each instance is solved independently) for a critical application in air traffic management.},

  abstract = {The massive integration of renewable-based distributed energy resources (DERs) inherently increases the energy system's complexity, especially when it comes to defining its operational schedule. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms arise as a promising solution due to their data-driven and model-free features. However, current DRL algorithms fail to enforce rigorous operational constraints (e.g., power balance, ramping up or down constraints) limiting their implementation in real systems. To overcome this, in this paper, a DRL algorithm (namely MIP-DQN) is proposed, capable of strictly enforcing all operational constraints in the action space, ensuring the feasibility of the defined schedule in real-time operation. This is done by leveraging recent optimization advances for deep neural networks (DNNs) that allow their representation as a MIP formulation, enabling further consideration of any action space constraints. Comprehensive numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, obtaining a lower error when compared with the optimal global solution (upper boundary) obtained after solving a mathematical programming formulation with perfect forecast information; while strictly enforcing all operational constraints (even in unseen test days).},

But, due to the nonlinearity of the traffic model, the optimization problem of the MPC controller will become intractable in practice when the scale of the controlled traffic network grows larger. To solve this problem, the nonlinear traffic model is reformulated into a model with only linear equations and inequalities. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) algorithms can efficiently solve the reformulated optimization problem, and guarantee the global optimum at the same time. Moreover, the MILP optimization problem is further relaxed by model reduction and adding upper bound constraints.},

The term is applied separately for tasks and resources correspondingly in task scheduling and resource allocation. Scheduling is a popular topic in operational management and computer science. Effective schedules ensure system efficiency, effective decision making, minimize resource wastage and cost, and enhance overall productivity. It is generally a tedious task to choose the most accurate resources in performing work items and schedules in both computing and business process execution. Especially in real-world dynamic systems where multiple agents involve in scheduling various dynamic tasks is a challenging issue. Reinforcement Learning is an emergent technology which has been able to solve the problem of the optimal task and resource scheduling dynamically. This review paper is about a research study that focused on Reinforcement Learning techniques that have been used for dynamic task scheduling. The paper addresses the results of the study by means of the state-of-the-art on Reinforcement learning techniques used in dynamic task scheduling and a comparative review of those techniques.},

As IP models many provably hard to solve problems, modern IP solvers rely on many heuristics. These heuristics are usually human-designed, and naturally prone to suboptimality. The goal of this work is to show that the performance of those solvers can be greatly enhanced using reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, we investigate a specific methodology for solving IPs, known as the Cutting Plane Method. This method is employed as a subroutine by all modern IP solvers. We present a deep RL formulation, network architecture, and algorithms for intelligent adaptive selection of cutting planes (aka cuts). Across a wide range of IP tasks, we show that the trained RL agent significantly outperforms human-designed heuristics, and effectively generalizes to 10X larger instances and across IP problem classes. The trained agent is also demonstrated to benefit the popular downstream application of cutting plane methods in Branch-and-Cut algorithm, which is the backbone of state-of-the-art commercial IP solvers.},

Most of the research done on the FCTL queue assumes that the vehicles arrive at the intersection according to a Poisson process and focuses on deriving formulas for the mean queue length at the end of green periods and the mean delay. For a class of discrete arrival processes, including the Poisson process, we derive the probability generating function of both the queue length and delay, from which the whole queue length and delay distribution can be obtained. This allows for the evaluation of performance characteristics other than the mean, such as the variance and percentiles of the distribution.

Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines, because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

  abstract = {The scheduling of production resources (such as associating jobs to machines) plays a vital role for the manufacturing industry not only for saving energy, but also for increasing the overall efficiency. Among the different job scheduling problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is addressed in this work. JSSP falls into the category of NP-hard Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP), in which solving the problem through exhaustive search becomes unfeasible. Simple heuristics such as First-In, First-Out, Largest Processing Time First and metaheuristics such as taboo search are often adopted to solve the problem by truncating the search space. The viability of the methods becomes inefficient for large problem sizes as it is either far from the optimum or time consuming. In recent years, the research towards using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve COPs has gained interest and has shown promising results in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. In this work, we provide an novel approach to solve the JSSP examining the objectives generalization and solution effectiveness using DRL. In particular, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm that adopts the policy-gradient paradigm that is found to perform well in the constrained dispatching of jobs. We incorporated a new method called Order Swapping Mechanism (OSM) in the environment to achieve better generalized learning of the problem. The performance of the presented approach is analyzed in depth by using a set of available benchmark instances and comparing our results with the work of other groups.},

  abstract = {Cooperation among the traffic signals enables vehicles to move through intersections more quickly. Conventional transportation approaches implement cooperation by pre-calculating the offsets between two intersections. Such pre-calculated offsets are not suitable for dynamic traffic environments. To enable cooperation of traffic signals, in this paper, we propose a model, CoLight, which uses graph attentional networks to facilitate communication. Specifically, for a target intersection in a network, CoLight can not only incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of neighboring intersections to the target intersection, but also build up index-free modeling of neighboring intersections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use graph attentional networks in the setting of reinforcement learning for traffic signal control and to conduct experiments on the large-scale road network with hundreds of traffic signals. In experiments, we demonstrate that by learning the communication, the proposed model can achieve superior performance against the state-of-the-art methods.},

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized reinforcement learning method for multiintersection traffic signal control on arterial traffic, by applying reinforcement learning control agents in each intersection. While applying individual control to multi-intersection problems faces many challenges, two main adjustments are made to optimize the overall performance: 1) to provide simple yet novel contextual information to individual agents and 2) to train the RL agents in a transfer learning way. We test our method on synthetic data dataset and show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-theart methods. We also interpret the policies learned by our method, which is the first time that the policy learned by the reinforcement learning control agents is interpreted using the traditional transportation coordination method on the arterial.},

  abstract = {Traffic signal control is essential for transportation efficiency in road networks. It has been a challenging problem because of the complexity in traffic dynamics. Conventional transportation research suffers from the incompetency to adapt to dynamic traffic situations. Recent studies propose to use reinforcement learning (RL) to search for more efficient traffic signal plans. However, most existing RL-based studies design the key elements - reward and state - in a heuristic way. This results in highly sensitive performances and a long learning process. To avoid the heuristic design of RL elements, we propose to connect RL with recent studies in transportation research. Our method is inspired by the state-of-the-art method max pressure (MP) in the transportation field. The reward design of our method is well supported by the theory in MP, which can be proved to be maximizing the throughput of the traffic network, i.e., minimizing the overall network travel time. We also show that our concise state representation can fully support the optimization of the proposed reward function. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms both conventional transportation approaches and existing learning-based methods.},

Specifically, the study applied data from Chicago and Philadelphia to examine how various producers of economic goods and services are sensitive to congestion, through its impact on business costs, productivity, and output levels. The data analysis showed that sensitivity to traffic congestion varies by industry sector and is attributable to differences in each industry sector's mix of required inputs and hence its reliance on access to skilled labor, access to specialized inputs, and access to a large, transportation-based market area. Statistical analysis models were applied with the local data to demonstrate how congestion effectively shrinks business market areas and reduces the "agglomeration economies" of businesses operating in large urban areas, thus raising production costs. Overall, this research illustrates how it is possible to estimate the economic implications of congestion, an approach that may be applied in the future for benefit-cost analysis of urban congestion-reduction strategies or for development of congestion pricing strategies. The analysis also shows how congestion-reduction strategies can induce additional traffic as a result of economic benefits.},

  abstract = {Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction enables safe, comfortable, and optimal proactive motion planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). Because of rapid advances in learning techniques and increasing access to massive amounts of data, deep learning techniques have been applied to predict vehicle trajectories, especially the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. However, the accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories for congested urban traffic remains problematic, as existing LSTM models do not perform well. To address this gap, this paper proposes to leverage an emerging deep learning technique\textemdash transformer\textemdash and utilizes a recently released dataset (pNEUMA) for predicting vehicle trajectories in congested urban traffic. The proposed transformer model uses the self-attention mechanism, which helps to identify dependencies within the model inputs, to systematically determine the impacts of vehicular interactions on the target vehicle's future trajectory. The pNEUMA dataset, which provides drone-based large-scale data of congested urban traffic, is processed to fit a typical trajectory prediction scenario, and used to train the transformer model. Numerical studies are conducted to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach. A comparison of the proposed model with representative LSTM models highlights the advantages of leveraging the transformer model characteristics for the vehicle trajectory prediction of congested urban traffic. By contrast, existing LSTM models may suffice for the trajectory prediction of freeway traffic. The results also indicate that, unlike for vehicle trajectory prediction for freeway traffic, a longer time window of inputs does not guarantee better prediction performance for congested urban traffic.},

Of particular interest are the intersections where traffic bottlenecks are known to occur despite being traditionally signalized. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence approach, has been adopted in traffic signal control for monitoring and ameliorating traffic congestion. RL enables autonomous decision makers (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research field. Open issues are presented toward the end of this article to discover new research areas with the objective to spark new interest in this research field.},

  abstract = {Traffic signal control is an emerging application scenario for reinforcement learning. Besides being as an important problem that affects people's daily life in commuting, traffic signal control poses its unique challenges for reinforcement learning in terms of adapting to dynamic traffic environment and coordinating thousands of agents including vehicles and pedestrians. A key factor in the success of modern reinforcement learning relies on a good simulator to generate a large number of data samples for learning. The most commonly used open-source traffic simulator SUMO is, however, not scalable to large road network and large traffic flow, which hinders the study of reinforcement learning on traffic scenarios. This motivates us to create a new traffic simulator CityFlow with fundamentally optimized data structures and efficient algorithms. CityFlow can support flexible definitions for road network and traffic flow based on synthetic and real-world data. It also provides user-friendly interface for reinforcement learning. Most importantly, CityFlow is more than twenty times faster than SUMO and is capable of supporting city-wide traffic simulation with an interactive render for monitoring. Besides traffic signal control, CityFlow could serve as the base for other transportation studies and can create new possibilities to test machine learning methods in the intelligent transportation domain.},

However, the design of effective PDRs is a tedious task, requiring a myriad of specialized knowledge and often delivering limited performance. In this paper, we propose to automatically learn PDRs via an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent. We exploit the disjunctive graph representation of JSSP, and propose a Graph Neural Network based scheme to embed the states encountered during solving. The resulting policy network is size-agnostic, effectively enabling generalization on large-scale instances. Experiments show that the agent can learn high-quality PDRs from scratch with elementary raw features, and demonstrates strong performance against the best existing PDRs. The learned policies also perform well on much larger instances that are unseen in training.},

  abstract = {Urban traffic control systems (UTCSs) are deployed to a great number of urban cities despite lacking feedback when adjusting the traffic signals. The development of reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to apply feedback to UTCS, and great efforts have been made on RL-based traffic control strategies. However, those studies are regardless of the traffic flow theory of the network and the road users' perspectives on the performance of traffic. This study proposes a multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) based traffic control strategy, in which each intersection in a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) region was controlled by one agent using the level of services (LOS) and MFD-based parameters as rewards. The proposed MARL strategy was evaluated by simulation in a 3\texttimes 3 grid network compared with pretimed, actuated, and MFD-based traffic control strategies. The evaluation results showed that, at different demand levels, the proposed MARL strategy outperforms the other three traffic control strategies in terms of average intersection queue length and average intersection waiting time to a different extent. Results also showed that the proposed MARL dissipated the congestion faster than the other three control strategies. Results of the Friedman test indicated that the differences in performances between the proposed MARL and other strategies were statistically significant regardless of the demand level. The MFD in the testbed network controlled by the proposed MARL was different from that controlled by the pretimed strategy, especially the MFD scatter plot. It provides insights on considering the traffic flow theory of the network when applying MARL to traffic control strategies.},
