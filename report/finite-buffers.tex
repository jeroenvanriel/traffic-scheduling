\section{Model definition}

Up to this point, we have not taken into account the fact that lanes between
intersection have finite capacity. We need to incorporate this aspect in order
to develop a model that could be used for practical applications. Under high
traffic loads, lanes with finite buffer capacity can give rise to
\textit{blocking} of upstream intersections. Therefore, the traffic controller
need to take into account these additional dynamics.

We start with a very simple extension of the single intersection scheduling
model that incorporates additional \textit{locations} on each lane. Instead of
only determining the arrival times of vehicles at intersections, the scheduler
has to determine the arrival and departure time of vehicles at every location.
We assume that it takes constant time $\Delta t$ for a vehicle to travel to the
next location.

For each lane $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$, let $m_{k}$ denote the number of
locations, excluding the entrypoint. Let the locations of lane $k$ be identified
by increasing numbers $\mathcal{L}(k) = (1, \dots , m_{k})$, where the last one
corresponds to the final intersection. In the following variable definitions, we
will not explicitly mention the dependency on the lane to keep notation simple.
Let $y_{ij}$ denote the time at which vehicle $j$ departs from location
$i \in \{ 0, \dots, m_{k} \}$, then $y_{ij} + \Delta t$ is the arrival time of
vehicle $j$ at location $i+1$. To simplify notation, we define
$\bar{y}_{ij} = y_{i-1,j} + \Delta t$ to be the arrival time of vehicle $j$ at
location $i$. For every location $i$ and vehicle $j$, we require
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:constr1}
  \bar{y}_{ij} \leq y_{ij} .
\end{align}
For each pair of consecutive vehicles on the same lane $k$ with precedence
constraint $j \rightarrow l \in \mathcal{C}_{k}$, we have the inequalities
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:constr2}
  y_{ij} + p \leq \bar{y}_{il} ,
\end{align}
for every location $i$ along their route. Furthermore, we assume that for every
vehicle $j$, the initial departure time from the entrypoint of vehicle $j$ satisfies
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:release}
 r_{j} \leq y_{0j}
\end{align}
in order to model the \textit{arrival time} of the vehicle.

Finally, we need to model the safety constraints involving vehicles from
different lanes that cross the intersection. Let $j$ be some vehicle on lane
$k(j)$, then let let $y_{j}$ denote the departure time from the intersection, so
we have $y_{j} = y_{ij}$ with $i=m_{k(j)}$. Similarly, let $\bar{y}_{j}$ denote
the arrival time of $j$ at the intersection, so we have
$\bar{y}_{j} = y_{i-1,j} + \Delta t$ with $i = m_{k(j)}$. From
constraints~\eqref{eq:constr2}, we see that it makes sense to say that vehicle
$j$ occupies the intersection during the interval
\begin{align}
  [\bar{y}_{ij}, y_{ij} + p] .
\end{align}
Like in the single intersection scheduling problem, we require an additional
\textit{switch-over time} $s$ whenever the next vehicle to occupy the
intersection comes from a different lane. Therefore, we obtain a similar set of
constraints for the intersection. Like before, let
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{D} = \{ \{j, l\} : j \in F_{k_{1}}, l \in F_{k_{2}} , k_{1} \neq k_{2} \} ,
\end{align}
denote the set of \textit{conflict} pairs. The additional disjunctive
constraints are
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:3}
  y_{j} + p + s \leq \bar{y}_{l} \text{ or } y_{l} + p + s \leq \bar{y}_{j} ,
\end{align}
for all $j, l \in \mathcal{D}$.

Let $\mathcal{J}_{k}$ denote the set of all vehicles that approach the
intersection from lane $k$. Suppose we want to minimize total delay at the
intersection among all vehicles, then the extension of the single intersection
scheduling problem can be stated as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:finite-buffer-problem}
  \text{minimize } & \sum_{j} y_{j} \\
  \text{s.t. } & r_{j} \leq y_{0j} & \text{ for all } j, \\
               & \bar{y}_{ij} \leq y_{ij} & \text{ for all } j \in \mathcal{J}_{k} \text{ and } i \in \mathcal{L}_{k}, \\
               & y_{ij} + p \leq \bar{y}_{il} & \text{ for all } (j,l) \in \mathcal{C}_{k} \text{ and } i \in \mathcal{L}_{k}, \\
               & \text{either } \begin{cases} y_{j} + p + s \leq \bar{y}_{l} \\ y_{l} + p + s \leq \bar{y}_{j} \end{cases} & \text{ for all } \{j,l\} \in \mathcal{D} ,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where we let $k \in \{1, \dots, K\}$ implicitly to simplify notation.

\section{Solution}

We can solve~\eqref{eq:finite-buffer-problem} by formulating it as a MILP using
the big-M method and solve it using standard software. To illustrate the model,
let us consider a small example.

\begin{eg}
  \label{eg:finite-buffers}
  Let $\Delta t = 1$, $p = 1$ and $s = 1$ and consider two lanes with
  $m_{1} = m_{2} = 5$. Assume we have the following arriving vehicles
  \begin{align*}
    F_{1} = (1, 2) , F_{2} = (3, 4, 5)
  \end{align*}
  with arrival times
  \begin{align*}
    r = (0, 1, 2, 3, 5) .
  \end{align*}
  The optimal schedule has objective {\color{blue}todo} and is illustrated in
  Figure~\ref{fig:finite-buffer-example-schedule}.

\section{Extending to network}

For every lane $(x_{0}, x_{1})$, let $m(x_{0}, x_{1})$ denote the number of
locations between both endpoints. Consider vehicle $j$ with route $R_{j}$. Let
$y_{ij}$ denote the time at which vehicle $j$ departs from location
$i = R_{j}(k)$ for some $k$, then $y_{ij} + \Delta t$ is the arrival time of
vehicle $j$ at location $R_{j}(k+1)$. To simplify notation, we define
\begin{align}
  \bar{y}_{ij} = y_{R_{j}(k-1),j} + \Delta t
\end{align}
to be the arrival time of vehicle $j$ at location $i = R_{j}(k)$. For every
location $i$ and vehicle $j$, we require
\begin{align}
  \bar{y}_{ij} \leq y_{ij} .
\end{align}
For each pair of consecutive vehicles on the same lane
with precedence constraint $j \rightarrow l$, we have the inequalities
\begin{align}
  y_{ij} + p \leq \bar{y}_{il} ,
\end{align}
for every location $i$ along the shared parts of their routes. Furthermore, we
assume that for every vehicle $j$, the initial departure time from the first
location $i_{0} = R_{j}(0)$ on the route of vehicle $j$ satisfies
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:release}
  y_{i_{0},j} \geq r_{i_{0},j}
\end{align}
in order to model the \textit{release date}.
