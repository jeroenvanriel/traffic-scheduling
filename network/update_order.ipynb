    "Suppose we want to perform a discrete-event simulation with online (re)planning of crossing times upon new arrivals to the network. In that case, we need to be careful in which order we move the vehicles forward such that the follow constraints are satisfied at all times. This roughly means that the vehicle furthest on a route needs to be processed before all other vehicles on that route. All these types of precedence constraints give rise to a certain \"vehicle update order\", which can be directly computed from the disjunctive graph, when available, but we can also use the schedule times y and the routes in the network to implicitly reconstruct the disjunctive graph. We do not return any representation of the disjunctive graph at this point, so we compute the vehicle order from the crossing times. Once we have a suitable way to encode the disjunctive graph, we can use the following code to test the implementation."
